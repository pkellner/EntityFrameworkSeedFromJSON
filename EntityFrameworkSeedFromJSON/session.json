Additionally, your specific manifest of \nlibraries and language versions may conflict with a developer’s environment, requiring the developer to make irreversible changes to the system environment or preventing them from using your sample code all together. \n\nWith Docker, it¹s possible to create a container that delivers exactly \nwhat the developer needs to start working with your code immediately. \nBoot2Docker makes setup on Windows and Macintosh simple, and on Linux the \nsetup is even more straightforward. This simple use case can improve the first time developer experience for your platform and increase engagement with your developer community. This approach has the added benefit of avoiding impact on your developers¹ \nexisting system and coding environment. Administrative privileges aren¹t required, and a \nDocker container acts as a sandbox to protect the main system from any ill \neffects. \n\nThis will be an interactive workshop, and interested attendees will have a docker container up and running by the end of the class.",

    "description": "Python is an agile object-oriented programming language that continues to build momentum. It can do everything Java, C/C++/C#, Ruby, PHP, and Perl can do, but it's also fun & intuitive! Enjoy coding as fast as you think with a simple yet robust syntax that encourages group collaboration. It is known for several popular web frameworks, including Django (Python's equivalent to Ruby on Rails), Pyramid, and web2py. There is also Google App Engine, where Python was the first supported runtime. Users supporting Zope, Plone, Trac, and Mailman will also benefit from knowing some Python. Python can do XML/ReST/XSLT, multithreading, SQL/databases, GUIs, hardcore math/science, Internet client/server systems & networking (heard of Twisted?), GIS/ESRI, QA/test, automation frameworks, plus system administration tasks too!\n\nOn the education front, it's a great tool to teach programming with (especially those who have done Scratch or Tynker already) as well as a solid (first) language to learn for non-programmers and other technical staff. Finally, if Python doesn't do what you want, you can extend it in C/C++, Java, or C# (even VB.NET)! Have you noticed the huge growth in the number of jobs on Monster & Dice that list Python as a desired skill? Come find out why Google, Yahoo!, Disney, Cisco, YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, LucasFilm/ILM, Pixar, NASA, Ubuntu, Bank of America, and Red Hat all use Python!",

AngularJS 2.x is also part of the \"MEAN\" stack (bonus points if you know this acronym) for Web app development. At the same time, it's important to be aware of the criticism that AngularJS has received (not just \"the good parts\"), and how those issues are addressed in Angular2.x.\n\nWe'll look at some AngularJS 2.x code samples using TypeScript (think classes, interfaces, and strongly typed variables), and some tips for writing AngularJS 2.x apps. This session is also helpful for the second session that delves into Web Components (and Polymer and more about AngularJS 2.x). If time permits, we can look at a fun example of using D3 in AngularJS, and AngularJS+SVG graphics on Google Glass (is that thing still alive???)\n\nWe'll wrap up with a raffle of some recent books: a Python Pocket Primer, a D3.js Pocket Primer, and another upcoming book.\n",

    "description": "C++14 has an enviable collection of functional programming features such as generic lambdas, type inference, variadic templates, function types with co-/contra-variance and so on. With mature compiler support, designing and implementing performant functional-style libraries has become very pleasant in modern C++. Tools and techniques (e.g., property-based testing) enjoyed by the programmers in only elite functional  languages (Haskell, Scala) now appear to be within C++'s reach. This presentation will discuss two classic techniques from the functional domain -- composable data generators and property-based testing -- implemented in C++14 for testing a generic serialization and deserialization library (RefleX). We will look at techniques of constructing complex generators using a random number generator and a tolerable dose of monoids, functors, and of course, monads. We won't stop there though! We will look at automatic type generators using C++ TMP. Equipped with data and type generators, we'll take property-based testing to a whole new level where lazy programmers don't have to do anything to test their programs beyond just compilation and running the test over and over.",

If so, why hasn't AOP been introduced into the mainstay of CS and Software Engineering curriculum in a way that OOP did?  In this talk, we will explore what AOP is, discuss the challenges we currently face in building multi-tenant applications , and also look ahead on how our Cloud Application Development challenges can solved.",

High performing teams are not only a joy to be part of, but also highly effective at delivering products that delight customers. </p>\n\n<p>The 2012 Study of Product Team Performance revealed five practices that, if product teams are doing them, gives them a 67% likelihood of achieving high team performance. (Similarly, if they practice none of them, they'll have a miniscule 2% likelihood of achieving high team performance!). </p>\n\n<p>The 2013 Study revealed rapid growth in the number of teams becoming agile - and fascinating insight into development methods and practices teams believe improve their products' profitability. </p>\n\n<p>This year we discovered the correlation with standups. (Make them effective, hold them daily.) And with tightly integrating user experience. </p><p>Study co-author Ron Lichty will present the insights we gained from the 2015 Study of Product Team Performance - as well as key findings from earlier studies. </p>\n\n<p>Join us and learn where you can focus to take your product team to awesome.</p>",

In this dense session Juval Lowy will explain his approach to large system analysis and design, using volatility to decompose a system into its comprising services. Juval will contrast it with the most common mistake done in architecture, using functionality to identify services. These are universal design principles, and Juval will use examples from software and non-software systems alike. You will also see how to overcome the real hurdles architects face pursuing volatility-based decomposing, simple and practical techniques for identifying areas of volatility, common telltale signs or \"smells\" when your design is still functional when using the Method, IDesign's approach for system architecture.",

We will demonstrate a solution to this problem: \"fake it till you make it\" with virtualized devices.  We will show how we implemented this idea for a healthcare app prototype by simulating the data from virtualized sensors representing real-time biometrics data from a doctor office/clinic. We use this data to power a healthcare app on the cloud which correlates data from body sensors with patient’s historical data and assists both doctors and patients in improving patient health.\n",

    "description": "Mobile developers typically have to choose between writing native apps or cross-platform apps. Native apps, written in Obj-C, Swift, or Java, give you great performance and full access to the platform's APIs. However, you need to write separate apps for each platform. Cross-platform apps, typically written in JavaScript, let you easily run on multiple operating systems. However, it's tricky using 100% of the native platform's APIs, and performance sometimes suffers.\n\nEnter Xamarin. Xamarin apps run with native performance, can use 100% of each platform's APIs, and provide significant code sharing across platforms. Xamarin apps are written in C# or F#, and benefit from the enormous .NET developer ecosystem. Xamarin development can be done on both Mac and Windows.\n\nThis talk will be an overview of Xamarin's various components followed by a deeper dive in to Xamarin.Forms. With Xamarin.Forms, you can write cross-platform user interfaces using XAML.\n\nIf you optionally want a free T-shirt, bring your laptop with Xamarin already installed. Download it from http://xamarin.com. Mac users should also come with Xcode already installed. Download it from the Mac App Store. Mac users can use the iOS Simulator which comes with Xcode. Windows users will have to either bring an Android phone with a USB cable, or install an Android emulator. Download the Xamarin Android Player, or use the VS2015 Emulator for Android. All of these downloads are large, so do them at home before SVCC starts.\n",

Much like a black box, there is no effective way for a network administrator to troubleshoot for dropped packets, let alone implement chargeback or showback for network services. \n\nIn order to address this problem, these architects who are now building today’s open source distributed systems have chosen open source technologies as building blocks. This session will explore how open source technologies, such as Apache Zookeeper, Cassandra and Prometheus, can be used to design distributed systems. Adam will demonstrate how to trace flows using open source technologies in OpenStack IaaS clouds.  \n\nArmed with their experience building distributed systems, these architects have leveraged their open source experience to not only build the network virtualization systems from scratch, using open source tools such as Zookeeper, Cassandra and Prometheus, they have also applied open source to build the monitoring tools to provide visibility back into these new virtual networks.

REST is an architecture style for building scalable web services. You've at least heard of it, you may have contributed to or even created 'RESTful' applications, but are you familiar with the basic constraints that make up REST?

The users will benefit of a lot more flexibility and design freedom.\n \nSo, we decided to integrate this feature in 4D Studio and do some user testing. We provided documentation and samples,  it went very well for people who knew coding and javascript. But still, for the others it was frustrating. We wanted to enable scripting for them too, so we studied various graphical languages and how we could integrate them.\n\nI will present how we evaluated the various options for graphical language: flow programming versus sequential programming. I will detail the pro and cons from a integration pov. \n\nTo solve this problem, we ultimately picked Blockly. I will show you how we integrated this graphical language to write augmented reality scripts. Building your own interactive 4d project has never been easier!\n",

    "description": "Over the past few years data has gone from the back office to center stage. Businesses realize that data and the business intelligence gained from it is one of the most valuable assets it possesses. Consequently data has migrated from vertical big iron systems to distributed horizontally scaleable systems with the potential for massive parallel processing. \n\nAnd that is not all. Data systems, once used for MapReduce and long running batch processing are now processing data at near real time. The innovations in this area are foundational and seismic. Newer data systems will provide personalization, recommendations, business insights in near real time.\n\nHowever, building, maintaining and managing these systems is non-trivial. There is a paradigm shift when dealing with distributed and partitioned data: how do we provide a consistent view of the distributed data; how do we maintain 24/7 availability; and how do we handle unexpected failures - and failures are always unexpected.\n\nThis talk goes into some of the principles and practices in distributed data systems, from messaging systems like Kafka to in-memory file systems and distributed caches. And it suggests best of breed practices to apply when building your own distributed system.\n\n",

And these patterns radically change the approach of developers and users of these systems. Without them, building and deploying distributed systems, especially at scale, becomes exceedingly problematic.

Play a game.\n• As kids get excited, unlock tokens like carrot, puddle, fence to teach conditionals (if/then/else), jump, strategy and play an intermediate level game. Play a game.\n• Next, introduce advance cards for learning iteration (loop/repeat) and function. Provide overview on how advanced card could be used to learn these concepts.\n• Finally, present other ways kids may learn programming fundamental with this simple board game (including dice fun, open play).\n\nKid while playing a board game and having fun would learn concepts on:\n• Sequence and Strategy\n• Conditionals if  <>  then <> else <>\n• Debugging\n• Iterations(loops) and Repeat\n• Functions\n\nThis is not a session for intermediate or advance Scratch or Tynker kids, but for young beginners who are getting introduced to coding.

Data Distribution Service (DDS) is the platform for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It offers real-time, peer-to-peer, standard, data-centric publish subscribe. With DDSConnector you can now exploit the power of DDS within node.js without having to deal with complex APIs. Define your data types, your data writers, data readers and desired quality of service in a XML file and simply load it in your node.js application. Your applications will effortlessly become participants in a logically shared, but decentralized peer-to-peer data-space with other applications over a LAN or WAN.  \n\nDDS is an open real-time connectivity framework standard that has proven itself in industrial systems for building highly reliable systems that can be trusted without a single point of failure, and as a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture with no message servers or brokers. If you need a connectivity framework that is fast, that can scale to hundreds of nodes, that is monitorable and robust, and if your system has to last, adapt to new technologies, work in heterogeneous environments or connect to legacy systems, DDS is the answer. If you have to do all that in node.js DDSConnector is your answer. \n\nWe will cover the basics  of DDS with some practical examples and then dive in a few demos on how to use DDS in node.js through DDSConnector. \n",

The Actor Model (conceived back in 1973) is a high level abstraction for writing concurrent and distributed applications. The core concept of \"actors\" alleviates the developer from having to deal with explicit locking and thread management, making it easier to write correct concurrent systems. \n\nAkka.NET is an implementation of the Actor Model and a port of the Akka framework, that has been around on the JVM for a few years.\n\nIn this session I will give an overview of the Actor Model; what Actors are, how they interact with messages and why they are inherently good at solving concurrent programming problems. I will cover concepts such as supervision and why this provides clean semantics for fault-tolerance and leads to systems that can self heal. In the second half, I will dive in to some code to demonstrate some of these concepts in a program implemented with Akka.NET.\n\nAfter this session I hope that you will have good understanding of the Actor Model and why you would want use it in your concurrent, parallel and distributed systems.",

    "description": "Big Data is defined by Volume, Variety and Velocity. Managing big data for ultimate app  experience is not an easy ask. Sound planning to store and manage your data sets goes long way in providing strong foundation for your app. Modeling is key.\nData modeling techniques  capture and translate complex system designs into easily understood representations of the data flows and processes, creating a blueprint for construction and/or re-engineering. Data modelers often use multiple models to view the same data and ensure that all processes, entities, relationships and data flows have been identified. There are several different approaches to data modeling, including:\nConceptual Data Modeling - identifies the highest-level relationships between different entities.\nEnterprise Data Modeling - similar to conceptual data modeling, but addresses the unique requirements of a specific business.\nLogical Data Modeling - illustrates the specific entities, attributes and relationships involved in a business function. Serves as the basis for the creation of the physical data model.\n\nin this session, based on above fundamentals, let us learn more about how we model for NoSQL big data storage engines like MongoDB, Cassandra and Hbase which  touch most big data apps today. You will learn row key and index designs. We will cover an app development and deployment at scale. We will go over  an example on how we enable a developer change data model on fly and deliver new feature for the app. ",
